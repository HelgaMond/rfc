# Tango Request For Comments (RFC)

This repository is the home of all Tango Open Specification.

The process to add or change an RFC is the following:

- An RFC is created and modified by pull requests according to the Collective Code Construction Contract [(C4)](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/1/README.md).
- The RFC life-cycle SHOULD follow the life-cycle defined in the Consensus-Oriented Specification System [(COSS)](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/2/README.md).
